# Free Web-Based Tools Collection
This repository is a collection of free, web-based tools that are available at no cost and require no download. My goal is to provide access to a wide range of tools that can help people solve problems, learn new skills, and be more productive, without the need for expensive software licenses or subscriptions.

# What's included?
My collection currently includes a limited set of web-based tools, but I plan to add more over time.

# Contributing
I welcome contributions to this collection. If you know of a great web-based tool that should be included, please feel free to add that into this collection to help as many people as possible so at least poor people of the world can solve their challenges and make money for surviving in this world because they cannot afford purchasing heavy and costly paid softwares so you are actually becoming part of a global and universal mission by doing your efforts for the sake of God (or for your own name if you do not believe in God). Everyone is equally welcome in this mission!
